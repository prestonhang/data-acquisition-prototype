## Description
One of the most important functions that users may desire include the ability to collect numerical data. This idea of a Data Acquisition system is present today; however, not very accessible to the average person. Currently, there is a gap between DIY and professional devices of this nature that we are trying to fill.
   
We are going to design a Personal Data Acquisition Device that bridges this gap. The project will be able to measure data from an accelerometer for easy storage and display. The device is tailored to be a wearable device that an individual can use to record live data from the sensor. The project incorporates an LSM9DS1 sensor, an STM32 Development board, a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, a CANBus data communication protocol, and a Flask app user interface.


## Software Dependencies
